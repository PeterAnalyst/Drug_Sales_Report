This measure generates a dynamic title for visuals showing “Top” or “Underperforming” customers by the currently selected metric (transactions, profit, revenue, or unit sold) based on slicer selections, for consistent, automated Power BI slide titles.

This measure calculates the total value of your selected metric for the top N customers (by that metric), showing either the total for all top N when no customer is selected, or each individual top customer's value while hiding non-top customers in your visuals.


TopCustomers = 
        VAR _TopCustomers = TOPN('Top/Bottom Drugs Slide'[Top/Bottom Values],ALL(CustomerTable[Full Name]),[Dynamic Measures],DESC)

This measure returns either the TopCustomers value or the Bottom Customers value depending on the user’s slicer selection (Switch Customer Top/Bottom), dynamically switching your visuals between showing top or bottom customer contributions.

Value Customers =

This measure calculates the percentage of total revenue contributed by the currently selected user or segment in your report.
